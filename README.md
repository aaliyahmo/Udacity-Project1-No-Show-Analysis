### Udacity-Project1-No-Show-Analysis

This is my first project completed with Udacity for the Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

#### Intro

A 'no-show' is term given to a patient who has scheduled an appointment yet did not make or 'show-up' to the appointment, this does not include a cancelation or a reschedule. Why is tracking no-shows so important? No-shows are a constant and long-standing issue for anyone in the medical field.

Missing an appointment doesn't seem like a big deal, however, almost half of patients skip their scheduled appointments. Studies have found that the healthcare industry loses billions of dollars annually due to no-shows.

Therefore, having accurate and consistant no-show data recorded, allows us to see how much of earnings are lost over time. Patients can miss appointments for many reasons such as logistical, environmenal and/or financial issues.


##### Questions to be answered by this dataset are as follows:

Does a longer wait time increase no-shows?
Do sms's decrease no-shows?
What ages tend to miss appointments more?
Which day has the most no-shows?
Does an increase in disabilities, increase the chances of them being a no-show?
This dataset tracks the no-shows in Brazil. The dataset [noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) was taken from Kaggle on 04/Aug/22. The data will be analysed using Python and Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib packages.
